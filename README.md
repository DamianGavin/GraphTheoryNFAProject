## GraphTheoryNFAProject

## Introduction

My name is Damian Gavin

This repository is my regular expression engine created by modelling an (NFA) Non-Deterministic Finite automaton in the
Go programming language.

This project is part of my Graph Theory module in my 3rd year Software Development course at GMIT.

## Setup Instructions

You need to have [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) installed to run this project. You will also need to have your `GOPATH` set up.

if you're on a Ubuntu based system, you can run the commands

machine.
If you have git installed you can clone the repository here:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DamianGavin/GraphTheoryNFAProject
```
to clone the project. You can also click on the "Clone or Download" button to download the project in a zip file.

```bash
cd GraphTheoryNFAProject
```
and run the program.
```bash
go run main.go
