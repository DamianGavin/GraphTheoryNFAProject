## GraphTheoryNFAProject

## Introduction

My name is Damian Gavin

This repository is my regular expression engine created by modelling an (NFA) Non-Deterministic Finite automaton in the
Go programming language.

This project is part of my Graph Theory module in my 3rd year Software Development course at GMIT.
